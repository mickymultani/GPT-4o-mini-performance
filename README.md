# GPT-4o-mini-performance
GPT-4o-mini : Quick setup to test chat performance of various Open AI LLMs

Clone the repo, replace the open AI key with your key, run the cells and choose the model per the prompt. 

In my limited tests:

1. GPT-4o-mini is ~69% faster than GPT-4-Turbo and ~58% faster than GPT-4o.
2. GPT-4o also consumed the least number of tokens to provide a meaningful answer.
3. GPT-4o-mini output was also on par with GPT-4o quality, both of whih were significantly better than GPT-4 Turbo.
